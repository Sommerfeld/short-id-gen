# short-ID-Generator (short-id-gen)

Build short IDs with 4 to 6 chars (0-9, A-Z, a-z).

This is a quick'n'dirty-tool. It's only used for public IDs - something like shortURLs - by my side.

## Install

	npm install short-id-gen --save

## Usage

	var shortID = require('short-id-gen')
	console.log(shortID.generate()) // zVe9op
